## Overview
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<i>Furni</i> is a fully functional theme that can be seamlessly implemented on any WordPress site.
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <i>Furni</i> theme was developed to transform an open-source Bootstrap design into a fully functional, easy-to-use WordPress theme. The Home, About Us, and Contact Us pages, complete with their default elements, evoke the aesthetic of a stylish furniture showroom or online store.

## How to install the theme
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The theme is built upon the open source <i>understrap</i> code base and consists of two key folders: </p>

1. <u>understrap</u>: This folder contains the template pages necessary for the theme's functionality.

2. <u>understrap-child</u>: Here, you’ll find the custom style modifications that enhance the theme's appearance. 
<p style="text-align: justify;"> To install the theme, simply add both folders to the designated <i>themes</i> directory of your WordPress installation. Once completed, you’ll find the theme readily available in your backend dashboard, waiting for you to activate and use it. </p>

## How to tweak this project for your own use
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
This project serves as a versatile foundation for a potential WordPress website theme. Built using the standard WordPress tech stack—comprising PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML—upgrading and customizing the theme is straightforward. I invite you to explore the theme and experience its capabilities for yourself!
